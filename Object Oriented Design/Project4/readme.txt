The format of the command for the server is 
ServerCtrlExecutive Time
The value of the time decides how many 100 ms will the server run. If no parameter assigned, it will run infinitely.

The format of the command for the client is 
ClientCtrlExecutive server_address file1 file2 file3....
The server_address specify the IP address of the server and file1, file2... specify the files to send to the file for inspecting.

Please use Visual Studio 2008 to compile my project since I use the devenv command to compile and link the project, or it may not compile correctly and crashs.
